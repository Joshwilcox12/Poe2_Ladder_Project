problems I ran into with this project:

api can only process 10 ids at once
different nested dictionary and lists
when key is missing in dictionary because not all items have it
renaming columns
api timeout


go back and understand how each json is saved in the list
how each chunk is saved in the list
how it gets all combined together
by end of project I should be able to explain each step that 
I am doing or else I didn't make this at all and it was all gpt
